Applescript code to get current computer name and IP addresses.

This was created to make it easier for users to get their computer name (same as hostname in our environment) so techs could access the computer via ARD.
The script grabs the computername, IPv4 from active inet connections, and a special grab of "utun" for Junos Pulse connections.
The output is offered to the user with buttons to copy the IP or Computer name to the clipboard for easy pasting into an email, etc.
